Welcome to the AfriLabs Terminal, an open source, data-driven portal for discovering opportunities for investment or social impact in Africa.

## About the Terminal

Welcome to the AfriLabs Terminal, a portal for discovering opportunities for investment or social impact in Africa.
 
This project contains data that is monitored, mined and made available by the team at AfriLabs. We take a different approach to sharing data about early stage-African investment opportunities by considering information about the communities companies operate in, in addition to traditional performance metrics.
 
Are you looking for the answers to questions like "Which companies working in industries with the highest known returns in Africa?" or "Which companies have the highest potential for social impact?" These are the types of questions users might ask (and have answered) by AfriLabs Terminal.

The Terminal also contains a number of charts and graphs for quickly interpreting the returned data.
